<pre style="color:darkgrey;font-size:20">
However, Apple isn’t pushing for higher education among all of its workforce. 
Only 71% ofits 100,000 employees earned bachelor’s degrees, and 28% report not having a degree at all.
This is due, in part, to the fact that not every employee is working on development in its Cupertino headquarters.
This can also be seen in the most prevalent skill among Apple’s ranks, software development (28%), with Java 
coming in second at 27%.
